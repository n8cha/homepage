# homepage
My personal homepage, hosted by GitHub pages.

Basically just a stylized text entry field that persists input in the browser's local storage (see disclaimer). Good spot to put an idea, or paste some links, or draft a message/email, etc.

**disclaimer:** not meant for storage of anything *remotely* sensitive
